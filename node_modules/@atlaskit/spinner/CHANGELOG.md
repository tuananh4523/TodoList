  This package's `peerDependencies` have been adjusted for `react` and/or `react-dom` to reflect the
  status of only supporting React 18 going forward. No explicit breaking change to React support has
  been made in this release, but this is to signify going forward, breaking changes for React 16 or
  React 17 may come via non-major semver releases.

  Migrated from `@emotion/react` to `@compiled/react` in order to improve performance, align with
  the rest of the Atlaskit techstack, and support React 18 Streaming SSR.

  Please note, in order to use this version of `@atlaskit/spinner`, you will need to ensure that
  your bundler is configured to handle `.css` imports correctly. Most bundlers come with built-in
  support for `.css` imports, so you may not need to do anything. If you are using a different
  bundler, please refer to the documentation for that bundler to understand how to handle `.css`
  imports.

  For more information on the migration, please refer to
  [RFC-73 Migrating our components to Compiled CSS-in-JS](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/rfc-73-migrating-our-components-to-compiled-css-in-js/85953).

  [`d2cf99ba208`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/d2cf99ba208) - [ux]
  Fixes two regressions introduced in v15.0.8:

  - There was a bug in the `xsmall` size variant of Spinner where the Spinner path appeared flipped,
    making the rotation look like the axis was off.
  - The addition of a wrapping span and layout change from `inline` to `inline-block` in v15.0.8
    shifted the spinner down slightly, causing potential flickers when scrollbars appear as content
    overflows in very tight layout scenarios. Please note that if you are using a Spinner in the
    `iconBefore`, `iconAfter` or `overlay` props of `@atlaskit/button` to create custom loading
    experiences, you are encouraged to move to using our dedicated
    [LoadingButton](https://atlassian.design/components/button/examples#loading-button) component;
    this takes care of all UX concerns for you, and ensures a smooth upgrade path for you in the

  [`206be3a0cb`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/206be3a0cb) - In this
  version we made spinner dramatically faster and lighter 🤩

  ### Fix: Mounting animation

  The mounting animation for spinner has been fixed. There are three parts to the mounting spinner
  animation:

  1. Accelerated spin
  2. Fade in
  3. Stretch (the spinner starts small and grows to a bigger size)

  In `12.x` the fade in and stretch parts of the animation were broken 😢. These have been fixed in
  `13.0.0` 🤘

  ### Changes

  _See below for information about a codemod we created to automatically upgrade usages of spinner
  ❤️_

  There have been a number of breaking changes in `13.0.0`.

  - Spinner no longer has a `peerDependency` on `styled-components@3`. Internally spinner is now
    using `@emotion/core` for styling
  - Added new `ref` prop which returns the `ref` of the spinner `svg` using `React.forwardRef`
  - Improved dark mode support (not that dark mode is truly supported yet). `appearance="invert"`
    will now invert the colors of the spinner in dark mode. Previously `appearance="invert"` in dark
    mode did nothing.
  - The default `delay` prop value has been reduced from `100ms` to `0ms`. The delay was previously
    designed to prevent the spinner from flickering if async content becomes quickly visible. Now
    that the fade in animation is working correctly, the spinner is only 2% visible at 100ms.
  - The `delay` prop is no longer useful to prevent "quick flickering" so the default has been
    changed. We have created a guide to assist you with better understanding how to use delays, as
    well as provided new guidance on how to cross fade a spinner with other loading content.
  - The `invertColor={boolean}` prop has been renamed to `appearance="inherit | invert"` to bring it
    into line with other components. This is useful when you are displaying a spinner on a
    background that is not the same background color scheme as the body.
  - Changing name of the `SpinnerSizes` type to `Size`. Most people are not using this type directly
  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete` props have been removed. Spinner no longer manages it's own
    unmount animations. If you want to have graceful unmounting we now have a recommended pattern
    which leverages our general purpose and performant `@atlaskit/motion` package. (Note: spinner
    will always animate itself in, you don't need to set anything up).

  ### Automatic upgrading

  ```
  # You first need to have the latest spinner installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/spinner@^13.0.0

  # Run the codemod cli
  # Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  #### Notes

  - You first need to upgrade to `13.0.0` **before** you run the codemod cli. This is because the
    cli will look in your local `node_modules` for the codemod which is published inside the
    `spinner` package.
  - The codemod is pretty clever, and will respect aliasing as well as using custom naming for the
    default import 🤘

  #### Feel the power

  What the codemod will do:

  - `delay`: replace literal number values equal to or less than 150ms as they are no longer needed
    to avoid flickering

  ```diff
  - <Spinner delay={0} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={100} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={150} />
  + <Spinner />

  // no change
  <Spinner delay={151} />
  <Spinner delay={myValue} />
  ```

  - `invertColor`: automatically changed over to `appearance="inherit | invert"`. All existing logic
    will be preserved in your code

  ```diff
  - <Spinner invertColor />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={false} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner invertColor={true} />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={expression} />
  + <Spinner appearance={expression ? "invert" : "inherit"} />
  ```

  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete`: removing props. But _it will not remove the state or functions
    associated with those props_. We cannot automatically remove the values or control flow
    associated with these props. **If you were using `isCompleting` or `onComplete` props there will
    be manual intervention required**.

  ```diff
  function App() {
    const [isCompleting] = useState(false);
    const onComplete = () => {};
  - return (
  -   <Spinner
  -     isCompleting={isCompleting}
  -     onComplete={() => {
  -       console.log('on complete!');
  -       onComplete();
  -     }}
  -     delay={1000}
  -   />
  - );
  + return <Spinner delay={1000} />;
  }
  ```

  If you were using `onComplete` for control flow, we now recommend using the performant and
  standard `@atlaskit/motion` solution

  ```js
  import React, { useState } from 'react';
  import Spinner from '@atlaskit/spinner';
  import appLoaded from './control-flow';

  function App() {
  	const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  	// faking the end of a loading event
  	useEffect(() => {
  		const id = setTimeout(() => setIsLoading(false), 1000);
  		return () => clearTimeout(id);
  	}, []);
  	return <Spinner isCompleting={!isLoading} onComplete={appLoaded} />;
  }
  ```

  ```js
  import React, {useState} from 'react';
  import Spinner from '@atlaskit/spinner';
  import { ExitingPersistence, FadeIn } from '@atlaskit/motion';
  import appLoaded from './control-flow';

  function App() {
     const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

    // faking the end of a loading event
    useEffect(() => {
      const id = setTimeout(() => setIsLoading(false), 1000);
      return () => clearTimeout(id);
    }, []);

    const onFinish = useCallback((state) => {
      if(state === 'exiting') {
        appLoaded();
      }
    }, []);

    return (
      <ExitingPersistence>
        {isLoading && (
          <FadeIn onFinish={onFinish}>
            {props => (
              <span {...props}>
                <Spinner size="xlarge" />
              </span>
            )}
          </FadeIn>
        )}
      <ExitingPersistence>
    );
  }
  ```

  - `SpinnerSizes` type: automatically shifted over to a new name: `Size`

## 13.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#2866](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/pull-requests/2866)
  [`54a9514fcf`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/54a9514fcf) - Build and
  supporting files will no longer be published to npm

## 13.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`206be3a0cb`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/206be3a0cb) - In this
  version we made spinner dramatically faster and lighter 🤩

  ### Fix: Mounting animation

  The mounting animation for spinner has been fixed. There are three parts to the mounting spinner
  animation:

  1. Accelerated spin
  2. Fade in
  3. Stretch (the spinner starts small and grows to a bigger size)

  In `12.x` the fade in and stretch parts of the animation were broken 😢. These have been fixed in
  `13.0.0` 🤘

  ### Changes

  _See below for information about a codemod we created to automatically upgrade usages of spinner
  ❤️_

  There have been a number of breaking changes in `13.0.0`.

  - Spinner no longer has a `peerDependency` on `styled-components@3`. Internally spinner is now
    using `@emotion/core` for styling
  - Added new `ref` prop which returns the `ref` of the spinner `svg` using `React.forwardRef`
  - Improved dark mode support (not that dark mode is truly supported yet). `appearance="invert"`
    will now invert the colors of the spinner in dark mode. Previously `appearance="invert"` in dark
    mode did nothing.
  - The default `delay` prop value has been reduced from `100ms` to `0ms`. The delay was previously
    designed to prevent the spinner from flickering if async content becomes quickly visible. Now
    that the fade in animation is working correctly, the spinner is only 2% visible at 100ms.
  - The `delay` prop is no longer useful to prevent "quick flickering" so the default has been
    changed. We have created a guide to assist you with better understanding how to use delays, as
    well as provided new guidance on how to cross fade a spinner with other loading content.
  - The `invertColor={boolean}` prop has been renamed to `appearance="inherit | invert"` to bring it
    into line with other components. This is useful when you are displaying a spinner on a
    background that is not the same background color scheme as the body.
  - Changing name of the `SpinnerSizes` type to `Size`. Most people are not using this type directly
  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete` props have been removed. Spinner no longer manages it's own
    unmount animations. If you want to have graceful unmounting we now have a recommended pattern
    which leverages our general purpose and performant `@atlaskit/motion` package. (Note: spinner
    will always animate itself in, you don't need to set anything up).

  ### Automatic upgrading

  ```
  # You first need to have the latest spinner installed before you can run the codemod
  yarn upgrade @atlaskit/spinner@^13.0.0

  # Run the codemod cli
  # Pass in a parser for your codebase
  npx @atlaskit/codemod-cli /path/to/target/directory --parser [tsx | flow | babel]
  ```

  #### Notes

  - You first need to upgrade to `13.0.0` **before** you run the codemod cli. This is because the
    cli will look in your local `node_modules` for the codemod which is published inside the
    `spinner` package.
  - The codemod is pretty clever, and will respect aliasing as well as using custom naming for the
    default import 🤘

  #### Feel the power

  What the codemod will do:

  - `delay`: replace literal number values equal to or less than 150ms as they are no longer needed
    to avoid flickering

  ```diff
  - <Spinner delay={0} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={100} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner delay={150} />
  + <Spinner />

  // no change
  <Spinner delay={151} />
  <Spinner delay={myValue} />
  ```

  - `invertColor`: automatically changed over to `appearance="inherit | invert"`. All existing logic
    will be preserved in your code

  ```diff
  - <Spinner invertColor />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={false} />
  + <Spinner />

  - <Spinner invertColor={true} />
  + <Spinner appearance="invert" />

  - <Spinner invertColor={expression} />
  + <Spinner appearance={expression ? "invert" : "inherit"} />
  ```

  - `isCompleting` and `onComplete`: removing props. But it will not remove the state or functions
    associated with those props. If you where using those props there will be manual intervention
    required. We cannot reasonably trace back and remove these values as they could be used for
    other purposes.

  _NOTE: values associated with isCompleting and onComplete props are not removed, just the props on
  the Spinner component_

  ```diff
  function App() {
    const [isCompleting] = useState(false);
    const onComplete = () => {};
  - return (
  -   <Spinner
  -     isCompleting={isCompleting}
  -     onComplete={() => {
  -       console.log('on complete!');
  -       onComplete();
  -     }}
  -     delay={1000}
  -   />
  - );
  + return <Spinner delay={1000} />;
  }
  ```

  - `SpinnerSizes` type: automatically shifted over to a new name: `Size`

  types are no longer provided.

  ### Breaking

  ** getTokens props changes ** When defining the value function passed into a ThemeProvider, the
  getTokens parameter cannot be called without props; if no props are provided an empty object `{}`
  must be passed in:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t(), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  becomes:

  ```javascript
  <CustomTheme.Provider
    value={t => ({ ...t({}), backgroundColor: '#333'})}
  >
  ```

  ** Color palette changes ** Color palettes have been moved into their own file. Users will need to
  update imports from this:

  ```javascript
  import { colors } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import { colorPalette } from '@atlaskit/theme';

  colorPalette.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  or for multi entry-point users:

  ```javascript
  import * as colors from '@atlaskit/theme/colors';

  colors.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  to this:

  ```javascript
  import * as colorPalettes from '@atlaskit/theme/color-palette';

  colorPalettes.colorPalette('8');
  ```

  - Drop ES5 from all the flow modules

  ### Dropping CJS support in all @atlaskit packages

  As a breaking change, all @atlaskit packages will be dropping cjs distributions and will only
  distribute esm. This means all distributed code will be transpiled, but will still contain
  `import` and `export` declarations.

  The major reason for doing this is to allow us to support multiple entry points in packages, e.g:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/colors`;
  ```

  Previously this was sort of possible for consumers by doing something like:

  ```js
  import colors from `@atlaskit/theme/dist/esm/colors`;
  ```

  This has a couple of issues. 1, it treats the file system as API making internal refactors harder,
  we have to worry about how consumers might be using things that aren't _actually_ supposed to be
  used. 2. We are unable to do this _internally_ in @atlaskit packages. This leads to lots of
  packages bundling all of theme, just to use a single color, especially in situations where tree
  shaking fails.

  To support being able to use multiple entrypoints internally, we unfortunately cannot have
  multiple distributions as they would need to have very different imports from of their own
  internal dependencies.

  ES Modules are widely supported by all modern bundlers and can be worked around in node
  environments.

  We may choose to revisit this solution in the future if we find any unintended condequences, but
  we see this as a pretty sane path forward which should lead to some major bundle size decreases,
  saner API's and simpler package architecture.

  Please reach out to #fabric-build (if in Atlassian) or create an issue in
  [Design System Support](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=24670) (for
  external) if you have any questions or queries about this.
