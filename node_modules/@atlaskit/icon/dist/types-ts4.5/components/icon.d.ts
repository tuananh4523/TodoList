 * @deprecated Custom Icon is deprecated and will be removed from `atlaskit/icon` in an upcoming major release. Please use either an existing icon from @atlaskit/icon or @atlaskit/icon-lab, or contributing to @atlaskit/icon-lab directly. For third party logos, use an SVG element along with a label.
 *
 * An icon is used as a visual representation of common actions and commands to provide context.
