  [`ec7295f858434`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/ec7295f858434) -
  The `useOpenLayerObserverBehindFG` has been removed. It was only created to support the feature
  flag rollout. You should use the `useOpenLayerObserver` hook instead.

## 2.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#168502](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/pull-requests/168502)
  [`9b40fe768e1a6`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/9b40fe768e1a6) -
  The `useOpenLayerObserverBehindFG` hook has been reintroduced with a null return value to resolve
  build issues. It will be removed in a following major release.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#157650](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/pull-requests/157650)
  [`3696befec09c1`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/3696befec09c1) -
  The feature flag for updating the experimental OpenLayerObserver to support closing and grouping
  layers has now been cleaned up.

  The `useNotifyOpenLayerObserverBehindFG` hook has been removed along with it, as it was only
  created to support the feature flag rollout.

## 2.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#141383](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/pull-requests/141383)
  [`5b44229081f06`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/5b44229081f06) -
  Extract type of NotifyOpenLayerObserverProps

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#134955](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/pull-requests/134955)
  [`eff111bcc88a5`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/eff111bcc88a5) -
  The experimental OpenLayerObserver now supports:

  - Closing layers - the `useNotifyOpenLayerObserver` hook now requires an `onClose` callback.
  - Grouping layers within a namespace. This allows observers to check the number of open layers
    within a specific "namespace", and narrow their onChange listeners to only be called when the
    layer count within that namespace has been changed.

  These changes are behind a feature flag.

  The `isOpen` parameter of the `useNotifyOpenLayerObserver` hook is now required to remove any
  ambiguity.

  [`10a0f7f6c2027`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/10a0f7f6c2027) -
  This package's `peerDependencies` have been adjusted for `react` and/or `react-dom` to reflect the
  status of only supporting React 18 going forward. No explicit breaking change to React support has
  been made in this release, but this is to signify going forward, breaking changes for React 16 or
  React 17 may come via non-major semver releases.

  functions:

  - `getCount`: returns the curent count of open layers under the observer
  - `onChange`: allows you to subscribe to changes in the layer count.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#147187](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/147187)
  [`f3fc0c5bb919d`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/f3fc0c5bb919d) -
  Adds a new experimental open-layer-observer entrypoint. It contains:

  - OpenLayerObserver: a context provider that contains a ref that tracks the number of open layered
    components underneath it in the React DOM.
  - useNotifyOpenLayerObserver: a hook for use within layering components (e.g. popup) that will
    notify its ancestor `OpenLayerObserver`s.
    - This hook is behind a feature flag.
  - useOpenLayerCount: a hook to be used within a `OpenLayerObserver`, that will return the layer
    count ref.

  The use case for this entrypoint is enabling wrapper components to determine if there are any open
  layering components contained within them. For example, the nav4 side nav will need to know if
  there are any popups or dropdown menus currently open within the side nav, so that if it is in
  flyout mode, it will stay locked open until the layered components are hidden or unmounted.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#127511](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/pull-requests/127511)
  [`db30e29344013`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/db30e29344013) -
  Widening range of `react` and `react-dom` peer dependencies from `^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ~18.2.0`
  to the wider range of ``^16.8.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0` (where applicable).

  This change has been done to enable usage of `react@18.3` as well as to have a consistent peer
  dependency range for `react` and `react-dom` for `/platform` packages.
