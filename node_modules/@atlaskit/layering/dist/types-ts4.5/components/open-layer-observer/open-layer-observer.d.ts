 * Context provider for observing the number of __open__ layering components (e.g. popups, dropdown menus) under the observer.
 * It uses a stable object to keep track of the number of open layered components - which means the observer will not re-render
 * when the number of layers changes.
 *
 * There should only be one `OpenLayerObserver` in the application. If there are more, the component will throw an error.
 * To track the number of layers in a section of the application, use the `OpenLayerObserverNamespaceProvider` to create a new
 * namespace to group layers.
 *
 * It is intended for use with the `useOpenLayerObserver` hook.
