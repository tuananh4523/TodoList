Layering aims to provide an out-of-the-box layered experience with consistent API. It also handles
multiple layers transparently. Layering uses React Context under the hood. We provide one component
API and one hook API to easily embed layering into your components. In other words, the API ‘mocks’
the layering structure by wrapping in Layering. It doesn't have to have correct component structures
for it to work. For example:

```ts
	<MinimizableModal>
		<ModalBody>
			{children}
		</ModalBody>
	</MinimizableModal>
```

The default layering behavior is to assume a parent component is the true parent of children. If
parent is not the true parent of children and they behave like they are, for example.

```ts
	<InPortal node={portalNode}>
		{children}
	</InPortal>
	<Parent>
		<OutPortal node={portalNode} />
	</Parent>
```

We need to manually mock the layering by adding `Layering` . See the usage for details.

## Usage

The layering is replied on React context. `Layering` can provide two context with the same API, one
is the global context(ie. out-most `Layering` This context is to track the level of the top-most
layered component), the other is component based context(ie. any `Layering` inside the out-most
`Layering` This context provides level of the given component). This means to use component based
context, we will have to make sure there is already a global context as the out-most parent wrapper.
See the usage below.

```ts
<Layering>
// global context must be the parent of all component based context
// unless we want to have another independent new layering system on the page.
// any direct children under global context will have level 1
// each Layering wrapper under global context would increase the level by 1
...
// inside the global context, we can have as many inner layerings as we want
// Modal, Popup, Dropdown are already wrapped under Layering internally
  <Modal> // level 1
    <Popup />
    <Dropdown />
    <NestedDropdown />
    <NestedPopup />
    <Calendar />
  </Modal>
  <Dropdown /> // level 1
// if the parent is not the true parent of children,we can add Layering around
// children to mock it make sure chidlren have one level higher than its parent.
  <InPortal node={portalNode}>
    <Layering>
      {children} // level will be 2
    </Layering>
  </InPortal>
  <Parent> // level will be 1
    <OutPortal node={portalNode} />
  </Parent>
</Layering>
// Layering established the system, to use and get the layering info, we can use useLayering in components.
const { currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled } = useLayering();
```

## API

### Layering

Layering is a component wrapper to provide layering context values so we can use layering hook to
consume the context. The usage is to wrap the component we want to be a layer, then inside that
component, we can utilize the hook to fetch layered information. See useLayering below.

```ts
<Layering>
  <ModalDialog .../>
</Layering>
```

Note: Layering has props isDisabled, default value is true Which means we disabled the wrapper
unless makers set isDisabled false, eg.

```ts
<Layering
isDisabled={getBooleanFF('platform.design-system-team.layering_qmiw3')
       ? false
       : undefined
}>
  <ModalDialog .../>
</Layering>
```

In this way we can control if we want to enable layering or not via feature flags. If we disable it.
Layering will be only an empty wrapper of children.

```ts
if (isDisabled) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}
```

### useLayering

useLayering is a custom hook used anywhere inside Layering. We are providing three values:

```ts
const { currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled } = useLayering();
```

In a multiple layered context, currentLevel indicates the level of the current layered component,
topLevelRef is a ref indicating the level of the top-most layered component. isLayerDisabled is a
function to determine if the component is disabled layer due to it is the top component.

We can use these values to help handle keyboard events and on close event.

The default values:

currentLevel 0 indicates no layering

topLevelRef null ref indicates no layering

isLayerDisabled false, if it is not true, means either no layering or it is a top layered
component(not just a component, should be a layered component wrapping in a enabled Layering)

Note: It is fine to call to call useLayering without Layering or within a disabled Layering . The
value will be either default values or the value of the previous layered component(means the current
component is not a layer). For exmaple

```ts
const CustomModal = () => {
  const { currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled } = useLayering();
  return (
  <Component />
  );
}
<div>
 // currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled are default values.
 <CustomModal />
</div>
// isDisabled is true by default, no need to include it if it is disabled.
<Layering isDisabled={true}>
  // currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled are default values.
  <CustomModal />
</Layering>
<Layering isDisabled={false}>
  // currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled are are 1, ref value 1, and false.
  <CustomModal />
</Layering>
<Layering isDisabled={false}>
  <Layering isDisabled={false}>
    // currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled are 2, ref value 2, and false.
    <CustomModal />
  </Layering>
</Layering>
<Layering isDisabled={false}>
  <Layering isDisabled={false}>
    // currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled are 2, ref value 2, and false.
    <CustomModal />
  </Layering>
  // currentLevel, topLevelRef, isLayerDisabled are 1, ref value 2, and true.
  <CustomModal />
</Layering>
```
