### Major Changes

- [#114024](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/pull-requests/114024)
  [`d2720e17d293e`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend-monorepo/commits/d2720e17d293e) -
  Migrated from `@emotion/react` to `@compiled/react` in order to improve performance, align with
  therest of the Atlaskit techstack, and support React 18 Streaming SSR.

  Please note, in order to use this version of `@atlaskit/motion`, you will need to ensure that your
  bundler is configured to handle `.css` imports correctly. Most bundlers come with built-in support
  for `.css` imports, so you may notneed to do anything.

  If you are using a different bundler, please refer to the documentation for that bundler to
  understand how to handle `.css` imports. For more information on the migration, please refer to
  [RFC-73 Migrating our components toCompiledCSS-in-JS](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/rfc-73-migrating-our-components-to-compiled-css-in-js/859)

  This package's `peerDependencies` have been adjusted for `react` and/or `react-dom` to reflect the
  status of only supporting React 18 going forward. No explicit breaking change to React support has
  been made in this release, but this is to signify going forward, breaking changes for React 16 or
  React 17 may come via non-major semver releases.

  Please refer this community post for more details:

  [`18d4f58b2d05d`](https://stash.atlassian.com/projects/CONFCLOUD/repos/confluence-frontend/commits/18d4f58b2d05d) -
  Motion now only accepts static duration values via the `duration` props of `SlideIn` / `FadeIn` /
  etc components. These have been replaced with an enumerated list of durations `small`, `medium`,
  `large` and `none`. This was done in order to support adoption of `@compiled/react`, which does
  not have support for dynamic css properties when in extraction mode.

  [`dd275c9b81`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/dd275c9b81) - Added the

  [`1e4930567c`](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1e4930567c) - There
  should be no noticeable changes to consumers of `motion`, but we now remove the animation styles
  once an animation is complete, or if the elements are not meant to animate on initial mount. This
  prevents a class of bugs where we were seeing unintended animations.

### Minor Changes

- [minor][1d72045e6b](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-frontend/commits/1d72045e6b):

  `SlideIn` is now more customizable and has new props:

  - **BREAKING CHANGE: ** `from` prop has been renamed to `enterFrom`
  - You can now optionally set an explicit `exitTo` prop which specifies which direction the
    component will animate towards when exiting. The `from` prop has also been renamed to
    `enterFrom`. If no `exitTo` prop is set, the exiting motion will default to being the reverse of
    the entrance motion. i.e. if `enterFrom={"right"}` then the element will slide in from the right
    and then exit towards the right as well.
  - You can now optionally set the prop `animationTimingFunction` to override animation curve to use
    when entrancing v.s. when exiting.

### Patch Changes

- [patch][24865cfaff](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/24865cfaff):

  New `<ExitingPersistence />` component

  You can now persist exiting elements using `ExitingPersistence`. Doing so will allow them to
  animate away while exiting.

  There are three ways you can utilise this component:

  **Conditionally rendering a single component**

  ```
  import { FadeIn, ExitingPersistence } from '@atlaskit/motion';

  ({ entered }) => (
    <div>
      <ExitingPersistence>
        {entered && (
          <FadeIn>{props => <div {...props}>hello world</div>}</FadeIn>
        )}
      </ExitingPersistence>
    </div>
  );
  ```

  **Conditionally rendering multiple components**

  ```
  import { FadeIn, ExitingPersistence } from '@atlaskit/motion';

  () => (
    <ExitingPersistence>
      {one && <FadeIn>{props => <div {...props}>hello world</div>}</FadeIn>}
      {two && <FadeIn>{props => <div {...props}>hello world</div>}</FadeIn>}
    </ExitingPersistence>
  );
  ```

  **Conditionally rendering elements in an array**

  Make sure to have unique keys for every element!

  ```
  import { FadeIn, ExitingPersistence } from '@atlaskit/motion';

  () => (
    <ExitingPersistence>
      {elements.map(element => (
        // Key is very important here!
        <FadeIn key={element.key}>
          {props => <div {...props}>hello world</div>}
        </FadeIn>
      ))}
    </ExitingPersistence>
  );
  ```

  Updated `<StaggeredEntrance />` component

  `StaggeredEntrance` no longer has the limitation of requiring motions to be the direct descendant.
  Simply ensure your motion elements are somewhere in the child tree and they will have their
  entrance motion staggered.

  ```
  import { FadeIn, StaggeredEntrance } from '@atlaskit/motion';

  () => (
    <StaggeredEntrance>
      <div>
        {items.map(logo => (
          <div key={logo.key}>
            <FadeIn>{props => <div {...props} />}</FadeIn>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </StaggeredEntrance>
  );
  ```

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [minor][5c3fc52da7](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/5c3fc52da7):

  The internal `Motion` component is now called `KeyframesMotion`.-
  [minor][1dd6a6d6ac](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/1dd6a6d6ac):

  `ExitingPersistence` now has an `appear` prop. Previously entering motions would always appear
  when mounting - now you have to opt into the behaviour.

  ```diff
  -<ExitingPersistence>
  +<ExitingPersistence appear>
    ...
  </ExitingPersistence>
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [patch][f175c8088f](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/f175c8088f):

  Fixes non-exiting elements from re-rendering unnecessarily.

### Patch Changes

- [patch][94abe7f41a](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/commits/94abe7f41a):

  New `useResizingHeight()` hook

  This is a small yet powerful hook which you can consume to enable an element to resize its
  `height` when it changes after a state transition. It uses CSS under-the-hood to maximize
  performance.

  ```
  import { useResizingHeight } from '@atlaskit/motion';

  ({ text }) => <div {...useResizingHeight()}>{text}</div>;
  ```

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes
