### Show

Using `Show` allows you to show the children using CSS `display: …` when the viewport size is above
a specified breakpoint. By default, unless the breakpoint is met, contents are hidden.

Children that are not shown are still rendered into the DOM, so there so there is typically little
performance savings — primarily that they are not painted.

### Mixing Show and Hide

Prefer using consistent `above` or `below` for readability and consistency.
