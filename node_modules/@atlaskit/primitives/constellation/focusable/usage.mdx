## Usage

It's important that every keyboard-operable part of an interface shows a clear focus indicator when
focused. This makes it clear which item has focus when navigating with a keyboard.

## Accessibility

### Include focus indicators on any keyboard operable UI

Most design system components have the focus ring or other focus indication built-in. If you are
composing a new component, make sure it includes a focus ring or other focus indicator.
