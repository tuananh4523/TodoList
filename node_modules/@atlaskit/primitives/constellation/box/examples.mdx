## Basic

Box is a general-purpose container that allows for controlled use of design tokens. Use the given
props to configure display behavior and styling that aligns with the Atlassian Design System. Use
[cssMap](/components/css/overview#cssmap) to style primitive components safely with tokens.

<Example Component={BoxBasic} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

## Padding

Use padding props to access spacing design tokens and control internal layout. The following example
demonstrates how each prop works with space tokens.

<Example Component={BoxPadding} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

The nomenclature used by these props follows
[logical properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties). This
naming is used to support different
[writing modes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode) in Atlassian apps.

## Background color

Box accepts a wide variety of background colors, referenced as semantic design tokens. For the full
list of color tokens, visit the [token list](/components/tokens/all-tokens).

<Example Component={BoxBackgroundColor} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

## Styling

Box exposes an `xcss` prop. This prop accepts `cssMap` function calls from our CSS-in-JS library
[@atlaskit/css](/components/css/overview#cssmap) which contains a subset of permitted styles.

For more information on cssMap, see the dedicated
[CSS library documentation](/components/css/overview#cssmap).

<Example Component={BoxXcss} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

## Conditional styles

To achieve conditional styles, we suggest composing conditional styles via the `props.xcss` API
rather than applying conditional behavior to individual props.

<Example Component={BoxConditional} packageName="@atlaskit/primitives/box" />

## Practical card example

Box is designed to be composed with inline, stack, and other components to create layouts.

Atlassian uses dozens of distinct card-like components across apps. Therefore, rather than providing
a strict component, the Atlassian Design System empowers and supports you to build your own card
components in ways that are consistent and will scale over time.
