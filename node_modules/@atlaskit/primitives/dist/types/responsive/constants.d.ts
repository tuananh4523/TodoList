/**
 * Our internal configuration for breakpoints configuration.

 * We explicitly use `-0.01rem` for "max" values to both ensure we do not overlap our media queries, but also don't skip any fractional pixels.  There is a chance this is not safe in some browsers, eg. Safari has weird rounding.
 * @see: https://tzi.fr/css/prevent-double-breakpoint/
 *
 * @experimental Unsafe for direct consumption outside of the design system itself; please use our `media` export instead for media queries.
