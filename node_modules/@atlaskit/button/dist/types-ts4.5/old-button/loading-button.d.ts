 * __Loading button__

 * @deprecated Legacy loading buttons are deprecated and will be removed from `atlaskit/button` in an upcoming major release. Please use the new Button components from `@atlaskit/button/new` with the `isLoading` prop.
 *
 * Please refer to the [migration guide](https://atlassian.design/components/button/button-legacy/migration-guide) for further details.
 *
 * A small wrapper around Button that allows you to show an @atlaskit/spinner as an overlay on the button when you set an isLoading prop to true.
